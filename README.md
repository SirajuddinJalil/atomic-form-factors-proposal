Research Proposal into Computing Atomic Form Factors for Physics Honours Thesis

The slides were presented to the research group as an Physics Honours thesis proposal
into X-Ray - Atom Scattering and Atomic Form Factors in early 1998.

The slides were prepared using the old seminar \LaTeX package (pre Beamer days) and hence
won't compile with pdflatex. It needs to be compiled using regular latex into DVI, converted
to postcript and then converted to PDF as follows:

    $ latex slides.tex ; dvips -t landscape slides.dvi ; ps2pdf slides.ps slides.pdf

The final slides can be downloaded from here:
